### SCRIMBA REAT (part 2)

I am taking **Scrimba** course in React after reaching the personal projects part of **freeCodeCamp** "Front End Development Libraries Projects". After first few projects done ("random quate machine" and "markdown previewer") both projects even tho completed and passed automated certification tests where not at a level I desired them to be so I decided to deepen my knowladge before continuing my jorney.

Both projects had some components render dynamicly useing an array. None of the projects still have any state.

#### LESSON PROJECT (Air BnB clone)

#### SOLO PROJECT (travel journal):

#### CONCLUSIONS:

Both of them are still very simple, had some dynamic and conditional rendering in them how ever nothing that was changing state... Projects that ware up to par with my projects done so far for "Front End Development Libraries Projects" certification.
